# RAG Chatbot - Quick Start Guide

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances AI responses by giving the chatbot access to your claims data and documents. Instead of relying only on pre-trained knowledge, the chatbot:

1. **Retrieves** relevant claims and documents from your database
2. **Analyzes** the information for relevance to your question
3. **Generates** personalized responses using both AI and your actual data

## Getting Started

### 1. Enable the Chat Widget

The RAG chatbot is already integrated! Look for the floating chat button in the bottom-right corner of the application.

### 2. Ask Questions

The chatbot can help with:

```
✓ "What's my claim status?"
✓ "How long will my settlement take?"
✓ "Which hospitals handle dengue cases?"
✓ "What documents do I need to submit?"
✓ "Tell me about my submitted claims"
✓ "I have appendicitis, where should I go?"
```

### 3. Enable Explanations

Click the **Brain icon** (🧠) to see how the AI arrived at its answer:

- **Reasoning Steps**: The logic used to generate the response
- **Confidence Level**: How confident the AI is (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **Key Data Points**: Specific claims or documents referenced

## Example Conversations

### Conversation 1: Claim Status

```
You: "What's the status of my recent claims?"
